This is my website, where I will post things that might be interesting.

## short
- support #gamergate
- check out [the vim wikia](http://goo.gl/WbjZox) if you want to compile Vim on
  Windows with Mingw. I just ran `mingw32-make FEATURES=HUGE GUI=no vim.exe` in
  the `src` directory of the Hg repository, and added the `src` directory to my
  path. Makes it easy to update in the future.

## long
I don't have anything long to say.
